5. **`1stCharacter`**
   - **Classification:** Illegal
   - **Explanation:** Function names cannot start with a number in Python. The first character of a function name must be a letter or an underscore.

7. **`BIG_NUMBER`**

8. **`π`**
   - **Classification:** Illegal
   - **Explanation:** While Python allows Unicode characters in identifiers, using non-ASCII characters like `π` is not recommended due to potential readability and portability issues. It's generally better to stick to ASCII characters.
