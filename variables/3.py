1. **`index`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `index` is in lowercase, which is typically used for variables or function names, not constants. Constants should be in all uppercase, such as `INDEX`.

2. **`CatName`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `CatName` uses CamelCase, which is non-idiomatic for constants. The idiomatic constant name would be `CAT_NAME`, using all uppercase with underscores.

3. **`snake_case`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `snake_case` is in lowercase and is more appropriate for variables or functions. The idiomatic constant name would be `SNAKE_CASE`.

4. **`LAZY_DOG3`**
   - **Classification:** Idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `LAZY_DOG3` is in all uppercase and uses underscores, following the convention for constants in Python.

5. **`1ST`**
   - **Classification:** Illegal
   - **Explanation:** Constant names cannot start with a number. The first character must be a letter or an underscore.

6. **`operand2`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `operand2` is in lowercase, which is typical for variables, not constants. The idiomatic name would be `OPERAND2`.

7. **`BIG_NUMBER`**
   - **Classification:** Idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `BIG_NUMBER` is in all uppercase with an underscore, making it a clear and idiomatic constant name.

8. **`Π`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** While Unicode characters like `Π` are allowed, it's non-idiomatic to use non-ASCII characters in constant names due to readability and portability concerns. The more idiomatic approach would be to use an ASCII character name like `PI`.
