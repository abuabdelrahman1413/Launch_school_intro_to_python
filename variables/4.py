1. **`index`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `index` is in lowercase, which is typically used for variables or function names. Class names should follow PascalCase (e.g., `Index`).

2. **`CatName`**
   - **Classification:** Idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `CatName` follows PascalCase, which is the idiomatic naming convention for class names in Python. Each word starts with an uppercase letter.

3. **`Lazy_Dog`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `Lazy_Dog` mixes underscores with PascalCase, which is non-idiomatic for class names. The idiomatic name would be `LazyDog` without underscores.

4. **`1ST`**
   - **Classification:** Illegal
   - **Explanation:** Class names cannot start with a number in Python. The first character must be a letter or an underscore.

5. **`operand2`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `operand2` is in lowercase, which is not the idiomatic convention for class names. The idiomatic name would be `Operand2`, following PascalCase.

6. **`BigNumber3`**
   - **Classification:** Idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** `BigNumber3` follows PascalCase, making it a valid and idiomatic class name.

7. **`Πi`**
   - **Classification:** Non-idiomatic
   - **Explanation:** While Unicode characters like `Π` are allowed, it is non-idiomatic to use non-ASCII characters in class names due to readability and portability concerns. The idiomatic name would be something like `Pi`.
